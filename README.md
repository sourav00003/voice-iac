# Voice-IaC â€“ Voice Controlled Infrastructure as Code

Voice-IaC is a voice-controlled Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) system built using Python and Terraform. It enables you to **create** or **destroy AWS EC2 instances** using simple spoken commands.

## Features

- Converts speech to text using Python (SpeechRecognition)
- Extracts key parameters like instance type, region, volume size, and action (create/destroy)
- Generates `main.tf` file dynamically from a backup template
- Initializes and applies infrastructure using Terraform
- Outputs the public IP of the EC2 instance
